  Ergonomics is the science of designing workplaces to fit the human body. It
  focuses on creating work environments that match our physical capabilities. By
  implementing ergonomic solutions, we can prevent work-related pain and
  injuries, especially those caused by Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs).
</p>
<p>
  This course will help with identifying risk factors in your workplace that can
  lead to MSDs. Learners will gain insights for creating a healthier work
  environment for themselves and their employees. By the end of this course,
  you'll be able to identify ergonomic risk factors in your workspace,
  proactively address potential problems, and implement effective solutions.
</p>
<p>
  While this course provides a strong foundation on ergonomics safety,
  consulting a certified ergonomist might be necessary for highly specialized
  applications.
