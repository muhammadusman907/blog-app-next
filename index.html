<!-- <p>Having completed the first three steps, it is now time to act!</p>
<p>
  When implementing the ergonomics program, start with small steps. Start by
  introducing a pilot program in a high-risk area. This approach enables testing
  of solutions, refinement of strategies, and demonstration of success before
  expanding implementation on a larger scale.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation also requires the determination of control solutions. Use
  the
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html"
    >Hierarchy of Controls</a
  >, which prioritizes the most effective measures. In this case,
  recommendations include implementing engineering controls, administrative
  controls, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We will explore
  the Hierarchy of Controls in more detail in the next lesson.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: Exploring various solutions based on identified risks is crucial.
  Testing interventions by piloting the chosen solution and monitoring its
  effectiveness is essential. This involves not only implementing the solution
  but also providing appropriate training on its proper use, and closely
  monitoring worker feedback throughout the intervention process.
