    A typical evaporative condenser has various design components, these are
    explained below.
  </p>
  <p><h5>Condensing Coil Arrangement</h5></p>

  <p>
    These coils, usually made from
    <strong>corrosion-resistant copper or cupro-nickel</strong> when used in
    ammonia systems, are arranged in a <strong>serpentine</strong> or
    <strong>finned-tube</strong> configuration to maximize surface area for heat
    transfer. The serpentine design allows for efficient refrigerant flow, while
    finned tubes enhance air-side heat exchange.
  </p>
  <p><h5>Water Sump and Distribution System</h5></p>

  <p>
    The <strong>water sump </strong>acts as a reservoir for the recirculating
    water. A <strong>suction strainer</strong> prevents debris from entering the
    <strong>water pump</strong>, which ensures a steady flow of water to the
    <strong>spray header</strong>. The spray header, positioned above the coils,
    houses numerous <strong>low-pressure nozzles</strong> that distribute water
    evenly across the entire coil surface, promoting complete wetting of the tubes
    for optimal heat transfer.
  </p>
  <p><h5>Fans or Blowers</h5></p>

  <p>
    <strong>Axial propeller fans</strong> are commonly used due to their ability
    to move large volumes of air efficiently. Alternatively,
    <strong>squirrel cage blowers</strong> can be employed in some designs. These
    fans draw air upwards through the wet coils, facilitating the evaporative
    cooling process.
  </p>
  <p><h5>Drift Eliminators</h5></p>

  <p>
    These are strategically placed mesh pads that capture water droplets dragged
    in the air stream exiting the condenser. This minimizes
    <strong>drift</strong>, and the unwanted loss of water droplets carried away
    by the air, reducing water consumption and potential environmental concerns.
  </p>
  <p><h5>Make-up and Bleed-off Water Supply</h5></p>

  <p>
    A <strong>make-up water line</strong> replenishes water lost due to
    evaporation. Regular <strong>bleed-off</strong>, where a portion of the sump
    water is replaced with fresh water, helps to control mineral buildup, and
    maintain water quality for optimal performance.
